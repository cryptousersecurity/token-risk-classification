  "description": "Tokens with modifiable tax allow the contract owner to change the buy or sell tax rates. This can cause losses, especially if the contract allows unlimited tax rate modifications, potentially making the token untradeable. This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract does not have an owner, or if the owner is a black hole address and cannot be retrieved, this function may be disabled.",
