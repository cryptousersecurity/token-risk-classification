  "description": "Ownership allows adjustments to contract parameters and status, such as minting, slippage modification, trading suspension, and blacklist settings. If the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or lacks an owner, these functions are usually disabled. However, these risky functions may be reactivated if ownership is reclaimed.",
