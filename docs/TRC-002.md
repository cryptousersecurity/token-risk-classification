# TRC-002 Mintable
## Description

Mintable indicates that the token allows for potential malicious minting. The deployer can continuously mint new tokens, draining the liquidity pool for profit. This can trigger a massive sell-off, causing the coin price to plummet and leading to significant losses for other token holders.

## Risk Pattern

```solidity
function mint(unit256 amount) external onlyowner {
  _balances[_msgSender()] += amount;
}
```
