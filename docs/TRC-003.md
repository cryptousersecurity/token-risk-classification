# TRC-003 OwnershipRetrieval
## Description

Ownership allows adjustments to contract parameters and status, such as minting, slippage modification, trading suspension, and blacklist settings. If the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or lacks an owner, these functions are usually disabled. However, these risky functions may be reactivated if ownership is reclaimed.

## Risk Pattern

```solidity
function lock(uint256 time) public virtual onlyOwner {
  _previousOwner = _owner;
  _owner = address(0);
}
 
function unlock() public virtual {
  require(_previousOwner == msg.sender, );
  _owner = _previousOwner;
}
```
