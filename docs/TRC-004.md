# TRC-004 BalanceManipulation
## Description

Tokens with this feature allow the owner to modify anyone's balance, potentially setting it to 0 or enabling massive minting and sell-off. This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or lacks an owner, ownership-related functionality is usually disabled.

## Risk Pattern

```solidity
function setBalance(address user, uint256 value) public onlyOwner returns (bool) {
  _balances[user] = value
  return true;
}
```
