# Token Risk Classification

Token Risk Classification(TRC) aims at identifying and cataloging scams like honeypots, and intentional backdoors that may be present in token smart contracts within the crypto ecosystem. This classification serves as:

- **A Shield against Malicious Contracts:** By showcasing a defined list of malicious token contract patterns, it empowers users and project teams to recognize and steer clear of contracts with hidden intents, thereby ensuring safer interactions within the decentralized space.

- **A Testing Ground for Developers:** With a clear classification of malicious patterns and real-world examples, developers creating tools to detect these malicious token smart contracts can effectively evaluate their systems against a standardized classification.

- **A Catalyst for Research:** By elucidating the deceitful practices adopted in token smart contracts, we aspire to drive more research towards crypto user safety, encouraging the community to devise strategies that deter such behaviors.

- **An Educational Asset:** This repository stands as an initiative to amplify awareness, serving as an informational reservoir, shedding light on potential contract pitfalls and deceitful patterns to the advantage of the community.

## Features

- **Descriptions:** Each pattern is thoroughly dissected, detailing its operation, potential consequences, and techniques for avoidance.
- **Real-world Samples:** For each pattern, contract samples that exemplify the described malicious intent are provided, forming a practical point of reference.
