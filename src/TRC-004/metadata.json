  "description": "Tokens with this feature allow the owner to modify anyone's balance, potentially setting it to 0 or enabling massive minting and sell-off. This function generally relies on ownership. If the contract's owner cannot be retrieved, is a black hole address, or lacks an owner, ownership-related functionality is usually disabled.",
